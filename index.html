    <h2>About the Braveheart </h2>
    <p>          Meghraj Singh was martyred in Imphal, he was awarded the Kirti Chakra in 1982. Meghraj Singh was in 17 Rajputana Rifles. On 27 January 1982, at around 4:45 in the evening, his squad saw two terrorists running in the street in front. When Naik Meghraj Singh chased them, a terrorist fired at him from a very close range, but Meghraj Singh showed courage and caught that terrorist.

He was a very big gangster of PLA. The Indian government had also announced a reward for his capture. A few days after this, on 4 February 1982, terrorists attacked Naik Meghraj Singh and his patrol squad in Imphal. During this, he was martyred in the encounter. On 15 August 1982, the then President Giani Zail Singh and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi honored the martyred Veerangana Vimala Devi by giving her the Kirti Chakra.</p>
